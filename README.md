# Algorithmic Patterns & System Design

For personal learning purpose, tracking my progress of working on practice problems in 2026.

## 📂 Architecture

- **`common/`**: Reusable data structures (TreeNode, ListNode) and testing utilities.
- **`01_Arrays_Hashing/`**:  Prefix Sums and HashMap optimization.
- **`02_Two_Pointers/`**: Shrinking windows and fast/slow pointers.

## 🛠 Standards
- **Language:** Python 3.13
- **Complexity:** All solutions include Time/Space complexity analysis in docstrings.
- **Testing:** Each solution includes a local `if __name__ == "__main__":` harness for debugging.

## 📈 Progress Log
- [x] **Project Setup:** Environment and Shared Utils configured.
- [ ] **Arrays & Strings:** In Progress (Focus: Space Optimization).
- [ ] **Sliding Window:** Pending.
